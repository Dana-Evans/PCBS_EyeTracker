# Projet PCBS : Eye Tracker

The goal of this project is to create a game based on the eye 
tracking the user allowing him to improve his focus. In fact tracking his eyes allows us to be able to evaluate 
how focused he is, and permits him to improve over time whilst playing.
In the end the game should look like a race, where the user can control a ball with his eyes.
