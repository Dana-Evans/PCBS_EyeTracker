# Projet PCBS : Eye Tracker

The goal of this project is to create an eye tracker and a game based it.Eye tracking the user will allow him to improve his focus. In fact tracking his eyes allows us to be able to evaluate 
how focused he is, and permits him to improve over time whilst playing.
In the end the game should look like a race, where the user can control a ball with his eyes while trying to avoid being disturbed by some background noise.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to get this on your local machine. For that you can use the following commands

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Dawarriorna/projetPCBS.git
$ cd projetPCBS
```

### Installing

Then you need to install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't have it. After that you can install the requirements with the following command :

```shell
$ python3 -m pip install --user --requirement requirements.txt
```

Then try to run the `main.py` file, if it runs, press q to exit
```shell
$ python3 main.py # press q to exit the program
```

##Â Generating the documentation

You may want to generate yourself the documentation, as if you change the code it won't be automatically updated.

```shell
$ make html # This will produce an output in the folder build/
```

To open the documentation, open the folder build/html/index.html.

If you wish to clean the documentation you can use the following command:

```shell
$ make clean
```

## Running the tests

You can easily run the test with sphinx like so:

```shell
$ make doctest
```

If everything went ok you should have the following output :
```text
