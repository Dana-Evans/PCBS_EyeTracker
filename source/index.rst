Welcome to Eye Tracker's documentation!
=======================================

Project description
===================

Summary
-------

The aim of this project is to create a home made eye tracker and use it in a game.
The game should be, in the end, a little race where the ball/kart moves toward the direction
of the user. The goal is obviously to beat records, however some obstacles, such as distracting
animations will pop on the screen to break down the concentration of the user. It will
eventually improve his focusing as well as keep him entertained hopefully.
If enough time is given some statistical data might be collected.

Code explanation
----------------

In this website you will be introduced to the code used and explanations will be given.
